Tried to add comments and make things as clear as possible.
Check the code for a better understanding             

## Question 1
Well I am a chill guy that tries to be better every day. I really into
adventures from hiking to skydiving, I enjoy music and from time to time
I try to improve my acoustic guitar skills. My major achievement was to
get into an exchange program from a College in USA, that was most growth
experience in my life so far.

I started my graduation without know much what computer science was
about but I loved it from the beginning. Firstly I engaged with a
group that was all about competing and solving problems, even though I
was quite good I didn't compete, which I kind of regret. In a few
semesters I got into an internship as web developer using Java and JSF(yeah...).
Then, when I graduated I started as a web developer in a remote job after that,
I received a proposal to work locally for pretty big company where I work until now. 
## Question 2
ruby question2/main.rb
## Question 3
ruby question3/main.rb

## Question 4
Well, for the problem one of the most effective technique would be a
Collaborative Filtering ("People who read this book also read...").
In addition we could also weight the books based on the genres,
taking in consideration the genres of the upvoted books of a user.
Finally we could do a fine-grained approach, correlating both results.
As a tool, for real time recommendations I would use a Graph database
such as Neo4j

## Question 5
